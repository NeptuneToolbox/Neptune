# Neptune
<b>Neptune</b> is a user-interface-based MATLAB toolbox that performs an array of spinal cord functional MRI pre- and post-processing steps, including functional connectivity and statistics.

<b>Why Neptune?</b> Spinal cord functional MRI data exhibit non-trivial distortions and elevated physiological noise that need to be mitigated properly. Neptune is an open-source tool, tailored to provide extensive and careful quality control in an elegant webpage format.

<b>Installation Instructions:</b>
1. MATLAB and AFNI must be installed and ready to use.
2. Download Neptune.
3. Unzip the downloaded Neptune folder.
4. In MATLAB, go to the unzipped Neptune folder.
5. Drag and drop the "setup_neptune.m" script to the command window (i.e., run the script). If you open the script in editor, it tells what it does
6. Check the command window for potential errors. If there are no errors, then Neptune is installed and ready to use.
7. Type "neptune" in the command window (without the quotes) and hit enter to run Neptune.

This is a work in progress. If you have trouble installing or using the software, or if you want to report bugs, share suggestions or provide feedback, please email me at: RDeshpande3@mgh.harvard.edu

Note: in the directory "older_versions", you can find previous public releases, which could help you compare different versions if needed. In the future, we will have documentation of the differences between different versions.
